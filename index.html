    I am a Computer Science graduate of the University of Derby and I am looking for an opportunity to apply the skills
    learnt throughout my degree course to a position in industry. An organised and motivated individual, I am also highly
    competent in working independently but have enjoyed working as part of a team on projects at university and during
    the IT support work I undertook during the summer breaks. I hold a full UK driving license and would be willing to
    travel. I would be an asset to any organisation and hope to make a valuable contribution to the success of
    my future employer.

<!--
  With this version of the website we took a look at html tables which can be
  used to create a visible table or to organise an entire website

  We used a table to format the way the webpage looked putting the image in a
  table row along with the data to format the page to improve its appearance.
  We also changed the tables cell spacing to create a bigger gap between the cells
  in the table.


  We also added a programming skills ratig table at the bottom of the page using
  a nested table to split two rows in half.
